### Perceptual Model for Adaptive Local Shading and Refresh Rate

* When the displays spatial and temporal sampling frequency is lower than that of the displayed signal, we see aliasing artifacts which are a common occurrence in real-time graphics

* CAMOJAB: CONTENT-ADAPTIVE METRIC OF JUDDER, ALIASING AND BLUR
*  our Adaptive Local Shading and Refresh Rate (ALSaRR) algorithm that uses our motion quality metric to determine the optimal distribution of shading rate and refresh rate under a given bandwidth constraint
* Real-time implementation. To reduce the performance overhead of our method, the quality predictions of CaMoJAB (Eq. (1)) are precomputed for every texture, mipmap level, and shading rate and stored as polynomials of the form:
* In comparison to Nvidia Adaptive Shading (NAS) [Yang et al. 2019], CaMoJAB is calibrated in physical units (pixels-per-degree, degreesper-second, cd/m2 ) and accounts for the display characteristics that affect motion quality perception, such as refresh rate, duty-cycle, and field-of-view. NAS may need to be recalibrated for a display of different size, brightness or pixel density than the one used by the authors. CaMoJAB has also been calibrated with several datasets, collected using psychophysical procedures, rather than tuned by the authors
